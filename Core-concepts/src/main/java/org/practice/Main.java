        * names start with org.studyeasy. Every component of the package name corresponds to a
        * subdirectory.
        *
        * In the following program, we have created two different packages. In both packages,
        * we have created the same name classes. The import statement in Java allows you to refer

        * unchecked exception are handled by the user (not mandatory) in case of occurrence of
        * such exceptions.
        *
        * If any code within a method throws a checked exception, then the method must handle the
        * exception or must specify the exception using the keyword throws.
        *
        * For example, consider the following Java program we make use of the FileReader class
        * object and initialize it.  The program is not compiled, because the main function uses
        * FileReader() and FileReader() throws a checked exception FileNotFoundException.
        *
        * To fix the above program, we need to specify the list of exceptions using throws, or we
        * need to use a try-catch block.
